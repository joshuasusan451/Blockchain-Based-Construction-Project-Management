# Blockchain-Based Construction Project Management

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain solution for managing construction projects, bringing transparency, security, and efficiency to the traditionally complex construction management process. The system consists of four key smart contracts that handle different aspects of construction project management.

## Key Components

### Contractor Verification Contract
Validates and stores credentials of qualified construction companies, ensuring only approved contractors can participate in projects.

### Material Verification Contract
Tracks the quality, origin, and delivery of building materials, creating an immutable record of supply chain information.

### Milestone Completion Contract
Records project progress against predefined milestones and automatically triggers payments when verified milestones are achieved.

### Change Order Contract
Manages modifications to the original project scope, documenting all changes with timestamps and approval signatures.

## Benefits

- **Increased Transparency**: All project stakeholders have access to the same immutable record of project activities
- **Automated Payments**: Smart contracts trigger payments automatically when predefined conditions are met
- **Reduced Disputes**: Clear documentation of changes and milestones helps prevent disagreements
- **Supply Chain Visibility**: Material origins and quality are tracked throughout the project lifecycle
- **Enhanced Security**: Blockchain technology ensures data cannot be tampered with once recorded

## Getting Started

Detailed setup instructions and documentation for each contract can be found in their respective folders.

## Use Cases

- Large-scale construction projects with multiple contractors
- Projects requiring strict compliance and documentation
- International construction where trust between parties may be limited
- Projects with complex supply chains and material requirements

## Future Development

- Integration with BIM (Building Information Modeling) systems
- IoT device integration for automated milestone verification
- Mobile applications for on-site contract interaction
